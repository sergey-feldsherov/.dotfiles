## TODO

- add all shortcuts stowed here (probably)
- maybe reorganize and move specific details to a separate readme in plugin's directory

## tmux

Plugins are installed via [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm),
some other things are reconfigured manually.

On a fresh system, after cloning TPM repo, hit `C-a I` to install all plugins.

## kanata

### systemd unit
Config is a mish-mash of stuff at github issue #130 on
https://github.com/jtroo/kanata.

### kanata.kbd

there's stuff.

### TODO

- add all shortcuts here
