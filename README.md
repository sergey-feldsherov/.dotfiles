Stowed:
* nvim

* kitty
* tmux
* guake
* htop (for fun)

Not synced:

## TODO

- add all shortcuts stowed here (probably)
- maybe reorganize and move specific details to a separate readme in plugin's directory

## tmux

Plugins are installed via [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm),
some other things are reconfigured manually.

On a fresh system, after cloning TPM repo, hit `C-a I` to install all plugins.

### TODO

- add all shortcuts here
- try to map Ctrl on capslock
- try `C-s` as leader key binding
- enable mouse?
